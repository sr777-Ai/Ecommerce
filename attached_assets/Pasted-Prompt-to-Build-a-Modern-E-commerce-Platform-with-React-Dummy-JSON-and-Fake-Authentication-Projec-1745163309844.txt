Prompt to Build a Modern E-commerce Platform with React, Dummy JSON, and Fake Authentication
Project Overview
Develop a fully functional front-end e-commerce platform inspired by Amazon, featuring a modern UI/UX, built with React and Tailwind CSS. The platform will use dummy JSON data to simulate products, user data, orders, and other entities, with no backend required. It will include a user-facing storefront and an admin panel, both accessible via fake authentication (hardcoded credentials). The application will support a comprehensive set of e-commerce features, including product browsing, cart management, wishlist, checkout, order history, user profiles, and admin functionalities like sales analytics and product management. All features will be implemented on the front end, with state management handled by React Context API or Redux Toolkit.
Technical Requirements

Framework: React (v18 or later) with Vite for project setup.
Styling: Tailwind CSS for responsive, modern UI/UX.
Data: Dummy JSON files for products, users, orders, and categories, stored in the /src/data directory.
State Management: React Context API or Redux Toolkit for managing global state (e.g., cart, wishlist, user session).
Routing: React Router (v6 or later) for navigation between pages.
Fake Authentication: Hardcoded credentials for user (user:password) and admin (admin:password) to access respective interfaces.
Dependencies:
react, react-dom
react-router-dom
tailwindcss
Optional: redux-toolkit, react-hot-toast (for notifications), axios (for loading dummy JSON)


No Backend: All data operations (e.g., filtering, sorting, updating cart) are performed on the front end using JavaScript.
Deployment: The app should be deployable on platforms like Netlify or Vercel for testing.

Dummy JSON Data Structure
Create the following JSON files in /src/data to simulate the database:

products.json:[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Wireless Headphones",
    "description": "High-quality noise-canceling headphones.",
    "price": 99.99,
    "category": "Electronics",
    "image": "https://via.placeholder.com/150",
    "stock": 50,
    "rating": 4.5,
    "reviews": [
      { "userId": 1, "comment": "Great sound quality!", "rating": 5 }
    ]
  },
  // More products...
]


users.json:[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "username": "user",
    "password": "password",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "role": "user"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "password",
    "email": "admin@example.com",
    "role": "admin"
  }
]


orders.json:[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "userId": 1,
    "products": [
      { "productId": 1, "quantity": 2 }
    ],
    "total": 199.98,
    "status": "Delivered",
    "date": "2025-04-15"
  }
]


categories.json:[
  { "id": 1, "name": "Electronics" },
  { "id": 2, "name": "Clothing" }
]



Features and User Stories
Below are the detailed features with corresponding user stories, grouped by user and admin functionalities.
1. Fake Authentication
Feature Description: Users and admins can log in using hardcoded credentials (user:password for users, admin:password for admins). Authentication is simulated by storing the user’s role in local storage. Users access the storefront, while admins access the admin panel.
User Story:

As a user, I want to log in with my credentials so that I can access the storefront and perform shopping activities.
As an admin, I want to log in with my credentials so that I can access the admin panel and manage products and sales.
As a visitor, I want to browse products without logging in, but I need to log in to add items to the cart or checkout.

Implementation Details:

Create a login page with a form for username and password.
On submission, check credentials against users.json. If valid, store the user’s role and ID in local storage and redirect to the appropriate interface (storefront for users, admin panel for admins).
Provide a logout button to clear local storage and redirect to the login page.
Protect routes (e.g., cart, checkout, admin panel) using a private route wrapper that checks for a valid user session.

UI/UX Guidelines

Color Scheme: Use a clean, modern palette (e.g., white background, blue accents for buttons, gray for secondary elements).
Typography: Use a sans-serif font (e.g., Inter or Roboto) with clear hierarchy (larger headings, smaller body text).
Layout: Follow Amazon’s layout with a fixed header, sidebar for categories (collapsible on mobile), and a footer with links.
Animations: Add subtle transitions (e.g., hover effects on buttons, fade-in for product cards) using Tailwind or CSS.
Feedback: Use react-hot-toast for success/error notifications (e.g., “Added to cart”, “Order placed”).

Example User Flow

Visitor: Lands on the homepage, browses products, searches for “headphones”, and views a product’s details.
User Login: Clicks “Add to Cart”, is prompted to log in, enters user:password, and adds the product to the cart.
Shopping: Adds more products, updates cart quantities, moves some to wishlist, and proceeds to checkout.
Checkout: Enters dummy shipping and payment info, places the order, and sees the confirmation.
Order History: Views past orders and checks details.
Admin Login: Logs in with admin:password, views the dashboard, manages products, updates order statuses, and deletes a user.

Deliverables

A fully functional React application hosted on GitHub.
A live demo deployed on Netlify or Vercel.
A README.md with setup instructions, feature list, and dummy credentials.
Comprehensive code comments explaining key functionalities.

Notes

Ensure all features are tested for responsiveness and accessibility.
Use dummy JSON data to simulate real-world scenarios (e.g., multiple products, orders).
Avoid external APIs; all data must come from local JSON files.
Prioritize a clean, intuitive UI/UX inspired by Amazon’s design.

This prompt provides a complete blueprint to build a modern e-commerce platform with React, dummy JSON, and fake authentication, covering all requested features with detailed user stories.
